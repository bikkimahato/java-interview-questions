## 6. What is a constructor in Java?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;  // Create a class attribute

    // Create a class constructor for the MyClass class
    public MyClass() {
        x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObj = new MyClass(); // Create an object of class MyClass
        System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 7. What are the types of constructors in Java?
- **Default Constructor:** A constructor that does not accept any parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor that accepts one or more parameters.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 8. What is a default constructor?
A default constructor is a constructor that does not take any arguments. If no constructor is defined in a class, the Java compiler creates a default constructor for the class.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;

    public MyClass() {
        // Default constructor
        x = 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.x); // Output will be 0
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 9. Explain method overloading.
Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, provided their parameter lists are different. It is a way to achieve polymorphism in Java.

```java
public class MyClass {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(10, 20)); // Calls int version
        System.out.println(add(10.5, 20.5)); // Calls double version
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 10. What is method overriding?
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog class
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 11. What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("This dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Calls the inherited method from Animal class
        dog.bark(); // Calls the method in Dog class
    }
}
```

## 12. Explain polymorphism.
Polymorphism in Java allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

- **Compile-time polymorphism:** Achieved by method overloading.
- **Runtime polymorphism:** Achieved by method overriding.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog class
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 13. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

```java
public class EncapsulationExample {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 14. What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. It helps to reduce complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound();
    }
}
```

## 15. What are the access modifiers in Java?
- **public:** Accessible from everywhere.
- **private:** Accessible only within the declared class.
- **protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **default (no modifier):** Accessible only within the same package.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 16. Explain the use of 'this' keyword.
The `this` keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. It can be used to refer to the current class instance variable, invoke the current class method, or return the current class instance from a method.

```java
public class ThisExample {
    int x;

    ThisExample(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Value of x is: " + this.x);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThisExample obj = new ThisExample(10);
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 17. What is a static method?
A static method belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be invoked without creating an instance of the class.

```java
public class StaticMethodExample {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticMethodExample.display();
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 18. What is the difference between static and non-static methods?
- **Static methods:** Belong to the class, can be called without creating an object, cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly.
- **Non-static methods:** Belong to an instance of the class, can access instance variables and methods.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 19. What is the final keyword in Java?
- **final variable:** Cannot be changed once initialized.
- **final method:** Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **final class:** Cannot be subclassed.

```java
public class FinalExample {
    final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

    final void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalExample obj = new FinalExample();
        System.out.println("MAX_VALUE: " + obj.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

## 20. What are the data types in Java?
- **Primitive data types:** byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
- **Non-primitive data types:** String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 21. What is the difference between int and Integer?
- **int:** A primitive data type.
- **Integer:** A wrapper class for the primitive data type `int`.

```java
int a = 10;
Integer b = 10;
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 22. What are the control statements in Java?
- **Decision-making statements:** if, if-else, switch.
- **Loop statements:** for, while, do-while.
- **Branching statements:** break, continue, return.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 23. Explain the use of break and continue.
- **break:** Terminates the loop or switch statement.
- **continue:** Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

```java
public class BreakContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                break; // Stops the loop when i is 5
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                continue; // Skips the iteration when i is 5
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```
