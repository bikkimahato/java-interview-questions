# Easy Java Interview Questions and Answers
## 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## 2. Explain JVM, JRE, and JDK.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** An abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** A package that provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applications written in Java. It does not contain tools for Java development like compilers or debuggers.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** A full-featured software development kit for Java. It includes JRE as well as development tools like compilers and debuggers.

## 5. Explain `public static void main(String args[])`.
- **public:** Accessible from anywhere.
- **static:** Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- **void:** Does not return any value.
- **main:** The main method is the entry point of the application.
- **String args[]:** An array of strings that stores arguments passed by the command line.

## 6. What is a constructor in Java?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;  // Create a class attribute

    // Create a class constructor for the MyClass class
    public MyClass() {
        x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObj = new MyClass(); // Create an object of class MyClass
        System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 7. What are the types of constructors in Java?
- **Default Constructor:** A constructor that does not accept any parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor that accepts one or more parameters.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 8. What is a default constructor?
A default constructor is a constructor that does not take any arguments. If no constructor is defined in a class, the Java compiler creates a default constructor for the class.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;

    public MyClass() {
        // Default constructor
        x = 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.x); // Output will be 0
    }
}
```

## 9. Explain method overloading.
Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, provided their parameter lists are different. It is a way to achieve polymorphism in Java.

```java
public class MyClass {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    static double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(10, 20)); // Calls int version
        System.out.println(add(10.5, 20.5)); // Calls double version
    }
}
```

## 10. What is method overriding?
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog class
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 11. What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("This dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Calls the inherited method from Animal class
        dog.bark(); // Calls the method in Dog class
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 12. Explain polymorphism.
Polymorphism in Java allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

- **Compile-time polymorphism:** Achieved by method overloading.
- **Runtime polymorphism:** Achieved by method overriding.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog class
    }
}
```

## 13. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

```java
public class EncapsulationExample {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 14. What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. It helps to reduce complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Dog();
        obj.sound();
    }
}
```

## 15. What are the access modifiers in Java?
- **public:** Accessible from everywhere.
- **private:** Accessible only within the declared class.
- **protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **default (no modifier):** Accessible only within the same package.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**

## 16. Explain the use of 'this' keyword.
The `this` keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. It can be used to refer to the current class instance variable, invoke the current class method, or return the current class instance from a method.

```java
public class ThisExample {
    int x;

    ThisExample(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Value of x is: " + this.x);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThisExample obj = new ThisExample(10);
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 17. What is a static method?
A static method belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be invoked without creating an instance of the class.

```java
public class StaticMethodExample {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticMethodExample.display();
    }
}
```

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 18. What is the difference between static and non-static methods?
- **Static methods:** Belong to the class, can be called without creating an object, cannot access instance variables and instance methods directly.
- **Non-static methods:** Belong to an instance of the class, can access instance variables and methods.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--easy)**
---

## 19. What is the final keyword in Java?
- **final variable:** Cannot be changed once initialized.
- **final method:** Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **final class:** Cannot be subclassed.

```java
public class FinalExample {
    final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

    final void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalExample obj = new FinalExample();
        System.out.println("MAX_VALUE: " + obj.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

## 21. What is the difference between int and Integer?
- **int:** A primitive data type.
- **Integer:** A wrapper class for the primitive data type `int`.

```java
int a = 10;
Integer b = 10;
```

# Medium Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Explain the concept of garbage collection in Java.
Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by identifying and disposing of objects that are no longer in use. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages this, which helps in preventing memory leaks. It utilizes algorithms like mark-and-sweep, generational, and reference counting to identify unreachable objects and reclaim their memory.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

## 2. What is the difference between heap and stack memory in Java?
- **Heap Memory**: Used for dynamic memory allocation where objects and class instances are stored. It is managed by the garbage collector.
- **Stack Memory**: Used for static memory allocation where method calls and local variables are stored. It follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

## 3. What is the purpose of the `finalize()` method?
The `finalize()` method is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object. It is used to perform cleanup operations before the object is reclaimed.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--medium)**
---

## 4. What is the use of the `System.gc()` method?
The `System.gc()` method is a request to the JVM to perform garbage collection. However, it is not guaranteed that the JVM will execute the garbage collection immediately.

1. **Feature file** (`src/test/resources/features/myFeature.feature`):
    ```gherkin
    Feature: My feature
    Scenario: Perform service
        Given the service is available
        When I perform the service
        Then I should get the response "Service performed"
    ```

2. **Step Definitions** (`src/test/java/com/example/StepDefinitions.java`):
    ```java
    import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
    import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
    import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

    public class StepDefinitions {

        private MyService myService;
        private String response;

        @Given("the service is available")
        public void the_service_is_available() {
            myService = new MyService();
        }

        @When("I perform the service")
        public void i_perform_the_service() {
            response = myService.performService();
        }

        @Then("I should get the response {string}")
        public void i_should_get_the_response(String expectedResponse) {
            assertEquals(expectedResponse, response);
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Runner Class** (`src/test/java/com/example/CucumberTest.java`):
    ```java
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.IncludeEngines;
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectClasspathResource;
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite;

    @Suite
    @IncludeEngines("cucumber")
    @SelectClasspathResource("features")
    public class CucumberTest {
    }
    ```

## 48. What is the use of the Cucumber framework in Java?

Cucumber is used for:
- **BDD**: Writing tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin language.
- **Automated Testing**: Automating tests based on feature files.
- **Integration**: Integrating with testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.

## 49. How do you perform closed-box testing in Java?

Closed-box testing can be performed by writing tests without knowing the internal structure of the code. This involves testing the functionality of the application based on requirements and specifications.

**Example**:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class ClosedBoxTest {

    @Test
    public void testCalculateSum() {
        MyService myService = new MyService();
        int result = myService.calculateSum(5, 3);
        assertEquals(8, result);
    }
}
```

## 50. How do you perform open-box testing in Java?

Open-box testing involves writing tests with knowledge of the internal structure of the code. This includes testing private methods, internal states, and interactions between components.

**Example**:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class OpenBoxTest {

    @Test
    public void testPrivateMethod() throws Exception {
        MyService myService = new MyService();
        Method method = MyService.class.getDeclaredMethod("privateMethod", int.class);
        method.setAccessible(true);
        int result = (int) method.invoke(myService, 5);
        assertEquals(25, result);
    }
}
```
